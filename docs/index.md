## Overview

Many established researchers have spent large amounts of time and effort setting up their analysis processes on institutional/local systems. Researchers often prefer not to change the way they work and are not willing or not ready to move to cloud-based data science. Yet, both researchers and data providers value the availability of rich cloud-based data sources for researchers to extract the scientific discoveries they provide.
